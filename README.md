## Description

This application was an assignment from The Ohio State Coding Boot Camp to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. I used Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user’s friend list
```


## Installation
 - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
 - [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
 - [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon)
 - [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)
 - [mongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
 - [mongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/install/)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local computer.
2. Run `npm i` in the command line to make sure all installations are complete.
3. Make sure MongoDB is installed and then run `npm start` to start the server. ( Or to use nodemon type `npm run dev`)
4. Navigate to Insomnia and then use the endpoints to create, read , update, or delete data in JSON format.
5. Optionally, once you have added data, you can open mongoDB Compass and view/edit the database from there as well.
